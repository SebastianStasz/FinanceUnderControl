# FinanceUnderControl

### Info

The third version of the application that allows you to manage your finances.

Due to lack of time, work goes very slowly. In the future, I plan to public the application in the app store.

Branch "test-dev/core-data-version" contains version that uses CoreData to store all data. On master branch there is a version that uses the Firebase, but is still in development.

### Features
- Adding cash flows: incomes or expenses.
- Grouping cash flows by categories created by user.
- Grouping categories by groups created by user.
- Currency calculator.
- Dashboard with some statistics about finances in current month.

My own packages used in the app: 
- SSUtils (https://github.com/SebastianStasz/SSUtils)
- SSValidation (https://github.com/SebastianStasz/SSValidation)

### Technologies

- CoreData
- Combine
- SwiftUI
